# Features and Functionality (WIP)

### User Interaction
-	Users can type messages, and the bot will respond in real-time if possible.
-	The bot can process and understand customer intents (e.g., product inquiries, troubleshooting).

### Product Information
-	The bot can retrieve product details from the database and present it to the customer.
-   This way, the user can be redirected to the product page (to purchase the product): Purchasing products will not be implemented in this project.
-   Products can be compared, a summary from an LLM Model will be included for each comparison

### Conversational AI
-	The bot can assist in troubleshooting, product recommendations, or answering general inquiries.
-   The bot is able to hold basic conversation with the customers. 

### Escalation to Human Agents
-	If the bot cannot resolve a customerâ€™s issue, it can escalate the conversation to a human agent for further support.
-   There will be a notification for human agents when escalating
-   The conversation with the human agents will be real-time
